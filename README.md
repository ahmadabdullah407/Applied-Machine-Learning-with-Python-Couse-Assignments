# Applied-Machine-Learning-with-Python-Course-Assignments
# Description:
This repository contains Ipython notebooks of assignments I completed in the course [Applied Machine Learning in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning),
part of [Applied Data Science using Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) from University of Michigan offered by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
## About This Course:
This course will introduce the learner to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods. The course will start with a discussion of how machine learning is different than descriptive statistics, and introduce the scikit learn toolkit through a tutorial. The issue of dimensionality of data will be discussed, and the task of clustering data, as well as evaluating those clusters, will be tackled. Supervised approaches for creating predictive models will be described, and learners will be able to apply the scikit learn predictive modelling methods while understanding process issues related to data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting). The course will end with a look at more advanced techniques, such as building ensembles, and practical limitations of predictive models. By the end of this course, students will be able to identify the difference between a supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) technique, identify which technique they need to apply for a particular dataset and need, engineer features to meet that need, and write python code to carry out an analysis. 
# Requirements:
- Python3.
- Jupyter Notebook.
- Libraries.
  - pandas.
  - numpy.
  - sklearn
  - scipy.
  - Matplotlib.
  - matplotlib.pyplot.
  - seaborn

# Repository go through:
1. There is a main directory in this repository.
2. All the Assignments and projects files in this course are present in Ipyton notebook format as well as html format.
3. Subdirectory named [readonly](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/Applied-Machine-Learning-with-Python-Couse-Assignments/tree/main/readonly) contains all the necessary files needed for these assignments.
# Final Course Project:
- Final Project of this course is named as [Assignment+4](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/Applied-Machine-Learning-with-Python-Couse-Assignments/blob/main/Assignment%2B4.ipynb) as it was 4th assignment for the course as well.
- In this Project, We created a function that trains a model to predict blight ticket compliance in Detroit using readonly/train.csv. Using this model,We returned a series of length 61001 with the data being the probability that each corresponding ticket from readonly/test.csv will be paid, and the index being the ticket_id.
# Reason to upload:
When I was doing this course, It helped me a lot in my understandings and concepts by comparing assignment approach i took and work done by other people. I am very hopefull that this would be the same for someone else.
